# How to Combine Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn Seamlessly

## Description
Machine learning workflows require several distinct steps â€” from loading and preparing data 
to creating and evaluating models. Python offers specialized libraries that excel at each step: 
Pandas handles data manipulation, NumPy provides mathematical operations, 
and scikit-learn delivers machine learning algorithms. While each is valuable independently, 
their true strength emerges when they work together.
